## Ack

This software wouldn't be possible without an number of people that wrote a lot of stuff that I simply happen to glue together - big thanks go out to: Ed Summers for his awesome [rdflib-microdata](https://github.com/edsu/rdflib-microdata) plug-in, William Waites for his permanent first-level Python support via [IRC](http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/), and Richard Cyganiak for the idea re the CSV parser.
